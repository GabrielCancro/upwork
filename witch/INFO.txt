Hi! The conditions are the same.
The finished project should contain the following set of files and information:
- APK file signed with the name of the application (once the APK is installed on the device, the name must be saved)
- AAB file with a caption of the application name
- Key for APK and AAB
- Key information (passwords, alias)
- Bundle ID / package name
- Version number and build number of the app
- Full source code or Source Code

For check apk / bundle ID (package name) / keystore / framework use this: http://checkout-apk.com/

Important Notes:
- APK icon must contain two sprites attached to the task
- APK and AAB files must work on 32-bit and 64-bit devices
- APK should be signed for release
- the target version of API Level (targetSdkVersion) must be higher than or equal to 31
- APK signature versions v1 and v2 (for this Android API must be 23 or lower)
- passwords and bundle IDs and package names must be free of "default" and "example"
- The application must contain the following set of architectures:
armeabi_v7a
arm64_v8a

All discussions can take place in this chat room. We will try to answer questions and/or check the task as soon as possible.

Send the source code and all the necessary files as a google drive link. The link must be active for at least one week after the confirmation of the task.

If you agree with the price, time (14 days) and task we can start.

Also, please fill the form for your developed application. We need info and more exact data for further work with the application as part of the coding and publication.
